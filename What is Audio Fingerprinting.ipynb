    "Music, it turns out, is digitally encoded as just a long list of numbers. In an uncompressed .wav file, there are a lot of these numbers - 44100 per second per channel. This means a 3 minute long song has almost 16 million samples.\n",

    "- 3 min * 60 sec * 44100 samples per sec * 2 channels = 15,876,000 samples\n",
    "\n",
    "A channel is a separate sequence of samples that a speaker can play. Think of having two earbuds - this is a “stereo”, or two channel, setup. A single channel is called “mono”. Today, modern surround sound systems can support many more channels. But unless the sound is recorded or mixed with the same number of channels, the extra speakers are redundant and some speakers will just play the same stream of samples as other speakers."

    "Why 44100 samples per second? The mysterious choice of 44100 samples per second seems quite arbitrary, but it relates to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorum. This is a long, mathematical way to say that there is a theoretical limit on the maximum frequency we can capture accurately when recording. This maximum frequency is based on how fast we sample the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this doesn’t make sense, think about watching a fan blade that makes a full revolution at a rate of exactly once per second (1 Hz). Now imagine keeping your eyes closed, but opening them briefly once per second. If the fan still happens to be making exactly a full revolution every 1 second as well, it will appear as though the fan blade hasn’t moved! Each time you open your eyes, the blade happens to be in the same spot. But there’s a problem. In fact, as far as you know, the fan blade could be making 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 100, or even 1 million spins per second and you would never know - it would still appear stationary! Thus in order to be assured you are correctly sampling (or “seeing”) higher frequencies (or “spins”), you need to sample (or “open your eyes”) more frequently. To be exact, we need to sample twice as frequently as the frequency we want to see to make sure we’re detecting it."
